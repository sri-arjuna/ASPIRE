Brief
-----
ASPIRE is a Python 3.3+ module that offers a line-based text user interface framework.


Detail
------
ASPIRE simplifies common tasks by providing various functions that wrap around frequently used code. It serves as a three-way interface between the system (MS Windows, any *Nix based system, and even Apple's iOS), the author/developer, and the end user.

One of ASPIRE's key focuses is to enhance the console experience by offering themable designs. You, as the author, can choose from a variety of ASCII-based themes that include colors, symbols, bold and underline fonts, and more. Users also have the option to select a different theme or even create their own.

ASPIRE is designed with simplified usability in mind for both end users and developers. It provides convenient functions such as `header`, `title`, `printe`, `ask`, `yesno`, `select`, `list` and `bar`. These functions aim to streamline interactions and improve the overall experience.


Target Audience:
----------------
For developers aiming to enhance the user experience with the console.


----

Installation / Usage:
=====================

Use as library or via pyinstaller:

````
from aspire import Aspire as tui

tui.header(str1, str2, str3)
tui.title("Hello World")
tui.printe(v_left, v_center, v_right)
````

By restructuring the content and refining the text flow, the README.md now offers a more readable and coherent representation of the ASPIRE module.

This is an unstable WIP, and some sayings of this text might refer to habbits that were based on the original source code, which was all BASH.

Brief:
-----

ASPIRE is a line based text user interface framework module for Python 3.3+.


Detail:
-------

ASPIRE provides many different functions that wrap around common used code that represent basic and everyday tasks.

The main focus of ASPIRE is to be a 3-way interface between:
* the system (MS Windows, any *Nix based system and thus Apple's iOS as well)
* the author / developer
* the end user

It does so and - on top of this - also bring some bling to the console, by providing a theme-able design, which can be chosen by you, the author.

The themes are ASCI based, provded color and symbols, even bold and underline fonts.

If you do desire, you can even let users change the theme to any included one, or even create your own ones.


It has simplified usablity for both, end user and author (you, the developer) in mind by providing functions like:
* header
* title
* printe
* ask
* yesno
* select
* list
* bar


# Target Audience:

For developers aiming to enhance the user experience with the console.

OLD name



SPYRE: Shell-based Python Runtime Engine
========================================


Brief:
------

Its a funny acronym-based-and-self-describing naming for an idea I've had back in 1995.

It offers functions that allow to create a line-based textual user interface, embracing its console'ness to the fullest.

Every 'TUI' was always trying to mimick a GUI, of which I always thought it would be kind of strange.


----

Abstract explanation of the name:
---------------------------------
 "SPYRE" represents a compact acronym that combines elements related to Python and TUIs. 
 
In this context, "SPYRE" can be interpreted as a term representing a hypothetical "Shell-based Python Runtime Engine".

It signifies a software component or framework that leverages Python for running and managing programs within a shell environment, specifically tailored for TUI-based applications. 

The term "Spyre" reflects the dynamic and active nature of the Python language within the context of a runtime engine designed for shell-based operations and interactions.



----

Certainly! Here's a playful acronym using the terms "Shell," "Python," "line-based," "text user interface," and "framework" to form the word "aspire":

"Achieving Seamless Performance In Real-time Environments"

This acronym captures the essence of these terms by emphasizing the goal of attaining smooth and efficient operation in dynamic contexts, which is often a common aspiration when working with shells, Python, line-based interactions, text user interfaces, and frameworks.
