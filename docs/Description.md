Intro / General:

ASPIRE is a line based text user interface framework for python.

This said, it is also an acronym: __Achieving Seamless Performance In Real-time Environments__

Keep in mind, that most other TUI (Text User Interfaces) attempt to mimick a GUI, which by defintion (graphic) they are not, since they still use text (by name).

With this in mind:
- ASPIRE emphasis line based output, and thus consle output as it is -> performance
- It aims to make the experience with the console more modern
- It is easy to use, thus for most projects, you will not need more than 5-7 functions which all are self-explaining by their names.

Its name is an acronym that for uses synonyms of the above description, while staying true to its meaning, by which I mean the following:
- Never before has anyone created a TUI (what is basicly is) that emphasis the console as it is, and actualy made use of its benefts.
- The console is a great medium for tutorials, wizards at a semi low level for systems, or performance intese tasks.
