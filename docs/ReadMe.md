Basics:

This is what you want to read / look at if you're absolute new to modules and specialy to ASPIRE.

- If you just need help to get started, please read: [[Usage](./USAGE.md)]
- and you will be interest in looking at [[Hello World](../examples/Hello_World.py)] as well.
<!-- Yes, I'm doing those double brackets on purpose, at least in this file! -->

Intermediate:
-------------

With this you *should* find something that is suitable for your needs.

- So you have a challenging or even complex project and need some more [[Details](Details.md)] how this works?

Advanced / Contributor:
-----------------------

- At this level, you might be interested in what I want (or have) [[TODO](./TODO.md)].
- But maybe you just need a more detailed [[Help](./HELP.md)] on how this project works behind the scenes?
