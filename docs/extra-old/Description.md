Intro / General:
================

## TLDR;


AspireTUI is a line based text user interface framework for python.

This said, it is also an acronym: __Achieving Seamless Performance In Real-time Environments__

Keep in mind, that most other TUI (Text User Interfaces) attempt to mimick a GUI, which by defintion (graphic) they are not, since they still use text (by name).

With this in mind:
- AspireTUI emphasis line based output, and thus console output as it is -> performance
- It aims to make the experience with the console more modern
- It is easy to use, thus for most projects, you will not need more than 5-7 functions which (hopefully) all are self-explaining by their names.


## Translations

Core language is english.

Once I consider most functions working I'll do a german translation. You'll be seeing it in ./AspireTUI/MESSAGES/german.py

After that point, feel free to submit any language that you've done a translation for.

This said, and to keep translation effort to a minimum, error messages intended for developers always remain english.

TODO


Its name is an acronym that for uses synonyms of the above description, while staying true to its meaning, by which I mean the following:
- Never before has anyone created a TUI (what is basicly is) that emphasis the console as it is, and actualy made use of its benefts.
- The console is a great medium for tutorials, wizards at a semi low level for systems, or performance intese tasks.
